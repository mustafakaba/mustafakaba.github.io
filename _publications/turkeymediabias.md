excerpt: "*Working Paper*


Previous studies on media capture strategies focused on either coercive measures (e.g., censorship) or direct favor exchanges in which the media outlet adopts a pro-government stance in return for state-advertising. However, most government favors to media owners occur in non-media sectors since advertising markets are tiny, while states frequently grant high-value contracts. This paper analyzes around 315,000 Turkish newspaper articles published between 2007 and 2009 to present evidence on indirect favor exchanges in which the government reciprocated the favorable coverage by granting state contracts to the media ownerâ€™s non-media businesses. I constructed two slant measures to show that contractor-owned newspapers are significantly more pro-government due to the opportunities to access state contracts. One such measure uses partisan phrases identified by analyzing a vast corpus of deputy speeches from the Turkish parliament. The other context-aware slant measure was developed from a state-of-the-art neural network model. Moreover, I leverage a legal change in the procurement law granting the government more discretion in the construction sector to show that contractor-owned newspapers became even more pro-government, and
started using more pro-government partisan phrases after the change.
