title: "Institutional Gridlock and Democratic Backsliding: explaining popular support for aspiring autocrats"

excerpt: "*Working Paper*


In recent years, the world has seen a wave of democratically elected leaders move their countries in undemocratic directions. Why do people support leaders who remove checks and balances? I argue that aspiring autocrats are more likely to gain popular support when they present these institutions as obstacles to getting things done. In doing so, aspiring autocrats exploit a critical tension between the possibility of gridlock and the abuse of power, which is inherent in democratic institutions. An original survey experiment conducted in Turkey supports these arguments. More interestingly, respondents perceive the aspiring autocrats' gridlock justification as a pro-democratic attempt to remove the obstacles to a policy-responsive regime. These results show that democratic backsliding is strategic, and its leaders exploit a tension in democracy that makes it harder for citizens to perceive the threat they face.
