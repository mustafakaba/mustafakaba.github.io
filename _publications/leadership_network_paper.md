Using uniquely detailed data from over 1700 professionals in 23 large corporations, we show that the gender of leaders has a significant impact on the structure of social networks within firms. Homophilic professional ties among male workers characterize departments with male leadership. Female leadership breaks male homophily and create a less segregated workplace. In female-led departments, both males and females establish more professional links with their female colleagues and leaders.  Workplace climate is healthier when workers establish professional support links with their leaders, and female leaders are significantly more likely than male leaders to develop such links with their subordinates. We also show that turnover is significantly lower in female-led departments. Our results suggest that increasing female presence in corporate decision-making positions may be a profitable way to improve organizational culture.
