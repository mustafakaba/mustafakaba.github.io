title: "Class Distinctiveness and Voting"
collection: research
permalink: /research/classvoting
excerpt: 'It is widely assumed that class divisions in economic preferences have become increasingly blurred over time due to higher living standards. Nevertheless, the previous literature lacks a systematic method to quantify the extent of this blurring of class divisions --if it exists at all-- and to track its evolution over time and across space. To this end, using predictive modeling, I first develop a new measure of class distinctiveness in economic preferences. I then estimate this new measure in 18 European countries for three points in time. After validating the newly developed measure, I test whether the class distinctiveness in economic preferences can explain the variation in the strength of class-based voting.
