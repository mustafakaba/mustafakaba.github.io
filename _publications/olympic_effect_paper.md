A reputation trap indicates a state of holding a bad reputation and not being able to escape it due to history dependence. It perpetuates itself because rational agents know that, even if they invest in good reputation, it is unlikely that the others will recognize this signal and deem it credible (Levine, 2019). However, one way out of the reputation trap is to have a third party or an international agency to signal the investment in good reputation to others on behalf of the bad reputation agent. In this paper, we test the empirical relevance of this argument by using the Olympic Games as the international agency to boost the reputation in terms of international trade. We specifically test whether hosting or bidding on the Olympic Games affects the international trade patterns of the host and bidding countries. We do so by building synthetic controls for host and bidder countries and identifying the trade effects of the Summer Olympics in the aftermath of the WWII. Our findings indicate that the hosting or bidding on Olympic Games bring about substantial trade effects. Nevertheless, the findings provide limited support for the reputation trap mechanism.
