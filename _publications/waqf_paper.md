Until the modernizing reforms of the 19th century, the Islamic waqf played a massively important role in the economy of the Middle East, the Balkans, and North Africa. Formally, it was a trust that an individual established in perpetuity to provide some service through the income of endowed assets. Most case studies of this institution focus on the largest waqfs, and especially on those founded by ruling families. For this reason, they give the impression that the waqf was primarily an instrument of social service, charity, generosity, and piety. Using a huge original data set covering the period 1500-1900, we challenge this common generalization. The data set draws on the records of Islamic courts in Istanbul—over the analyzed period, the Ottoman capital and the leading economic hub of the Eastern Mediterranean. The city’s largest waqfs were established by high elites to provide social services now supplied by municipalities or charitable corporations. Examples include those supporting hospitals, colleges, and major soup kitchens. But the typical waqf, whose endowment and architectural footprint were more modest, was established primarily to provide material security to its founder. As a rule, piety played a much smaller role than the literature tends to convey. In a social setting characterized by weak property rights and a biased legal system, economically vulnerable demographic groups tended to use waqfs as instruments of material security. Such groups included commoners and females.
