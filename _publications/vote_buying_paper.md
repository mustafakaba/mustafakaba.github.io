In this paper, I estimate the causal effects of a local food-subsidy program on electoral outcomes. I exploit the variation in voters walking distances from the program stores to identify their accessibility to the program. I find that a distributive spending in the amount of ~5% of GDP per capita buys an additional vote for the incumbent. I then investigate who --based on partisanship-- responds to the subsidy, and how much and how they respond. The findings indicate that all types of voters respond to the distributive spending in line with the reciprocity rule; however, they respond through different channels and in different magnitude. Importantly, the salient channel for opposition voters is abstention-buying, whereas incumbent supporters respond by an increased turnout.
