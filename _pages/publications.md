	<font size="2.5"> In this paper, I estimate the causal effect of a local food-subsidy program on electoral outcomes. I exploit the variation in voters’ walking distances from the program stores to identify their accessibility to the program. I find that a distributive spending of ~5% of GDP per capita buys an additional vote for the incumbent. I then investigate who –based on partisanship– responds to the subsidy, and how much and how they respond. The findings indicate that all types of voters respond to the distributive spending in line with the reciprocity rule; however, they respond through different channels and in different magnitude. Importantly, the salient channel for opposition voters is abstention-buying, whereas incumbent supporters respond by an increased turnout. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Leadership, Social Networks and Workplace Climate Through a Gender Lens
	*(with [Sule Alan](https://sulealan.com/), [Gozde Corekcioglu](https://www.gozdecorekcioglu.com), [Matthias Sutter](https://www.coll.mpg.de/matthias-sutter))* </span>
	
	 <font size="2.5"> Using uniquely detailed data from over 1700 professionals in 23 large corporations, we show that the gender of leaders has a significant impact on the structure of social networks within firms. Homophilic professional ties among male workers characterize departments with male leadership. Female leadership breaks male homophily and create a less segregated workplace. In female-led departments, both males and females establish more professional links with their female colleagues and leaders.  Workplace climate is healthier when workers establish professional support links with their leaders, and female leaders are significantly more likely than male leaders to develop such links with their subordinates. We also show that turnover is significantly lower in female-led departments. Our results suggest that increasing female presence in corporate decision-making positions may be a profitable way to improve organizational culture. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> The Olympic effect: a synthetic control approach
	*(with [Nicole Stoelinga](https://www.nicolestoelinga.com/home))* </span>
	
	<font size="2.5"> Hosting the Olympic Games implies tremendous costs and uncertain profits, yet countries strive to host the event. A prominent explanation for this puzzling interest is the so-called Olympic effect: the positive impact of the Olympics on international trade. In this paper, we estimate the Olympic effect on long-term exports for host and bidding countries using the synthetic control method. We show that the Olympic effect is most pronounced for countries that stand to gain from an international publicity and signaling trade liberalization. We also show that a substantial positive Olympic effect is only associated with the earlier games. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Class Distinctiveness and Voting: a cross-country comparison </span>
	
	<font size="2.5"> It is widely assumed that social class divisions in economic preferences have become increasingly blurred over time due to higher living standards. Nevertheless, the previous literature lacks a systematic method to quantify the extent of this blurring of class divisions –if it exists at all– and to track its evolution over time and across space. To this end, using predictive modeling, I first develop a new measure of class distinctiveness in economic preferences. I then estimate this new measure in 18 European countries for three points in time. After validating the newly developed measure, I test whether the class distinctiveness in economic preferences can explain the variation in the strength of class-based voting. </font>
