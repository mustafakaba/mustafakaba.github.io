* <span style="color:Black"> Leadership, Social Networks and Workplace Climate Through a Gender Lens
	*(with [Sule Alan](https://sulealan.com/), [Gozde Corekcioglu](https://www.gozdecorekcioglu.com), [Matthias Sutter](https://www.coll.mpg.de/matthias-sutter))* </span>
	
	 <font size="2.5">  Using uniquely detailed data from over 1700 professionals in 23 large corporations, we show that the gender of leaders has a significant impact on the structure of social networks within firms. Homophilic professional ties among male workers characterize departments with male leadership. Female leadership breaks male homophily and create a less segregated workplace. Under female leadership, both males and females establish more professional links with their female colleagues. Workplace climate is healthier when workers establish professional support links with their leaders, and female leaders are significantly more likely than male leaders to develop such links with their female subordinates. Our results suggest that increasing female presence in corporate decision-making positions may be a profitable way to improve organizational culture. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> The Olympic Effect: Fact or Fiction?
	*(with [Nicole Stoelinga](https://www.nicolestoelinga.com/home))* </span> <b>Under Review</b>
	
	<font size="2.5"> Hosting the Olympic Games implies tremendous costs and uncertain profits, yet countries historically have been striving to host this mega event and bidding decisively. More recently though, countries are withdrawing their bids from the election procedure. This puzzling historical interest in hosting the games and the recent trend of withdrawals cast doubt on the existence of the so-called Olympic effect: the positive impact of the Olympics on international trade. In this paper, we estimate the Olympic effect on long-term exports using the synthetic control method. We show that the Olympic effect is more pronounced for countries that stand to gain from an international publicity. The results also present the novel insight that a substantial positive Olympic effect is only associated with earlier games. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Class Voting and Economic Policy Preferences: a predictive modelling approach </span>
	
	<font size="2.5"> It is widely assumed that class divisions in economic preferences have become increasingly blurred over time due to higher living standards. Nevertheless, the previous literature lacks a systematic method to quantify the extent of this blurring of class divisions --if it exists at all-- and to track its evolution over time and across space. To this end, using predictive modeling, I first develop a new measure of class distinctiveness in economic preferences. I then estimate this new measure in 18 European countries for three points in time. After validating the newly developed measure, I test whether the class distinctiveness in economic preferences can explain the variation in the strength of class-based voting. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Who buys vote-buying? How, how much, and at what cost?, <b>*Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization*</b> 193 (2022): 98-124. </span>

	<font size="2.5"> In this paper, I estimate the causal effect of a local food-subsidy program on electoral outcomes. I exploit the variation in voters’ walking distances from the program stores to identify their accessibility to the program. I find that a distributive spending of ~5% of GDP per capita buys an additional vote for the incumbent. I then investigate who –based on partisanship– responds to the subsidy, and how much and how they respond. The findings indicate that all types of voters respond to the distributive spending in line with the reciprocity rule; however, they respond through different channels and in different magnitude. Importantly, the salient channel for opposition voters is abstention-buying, whereas incumbent supporters respond by an increased turnout. </font>
