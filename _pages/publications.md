* <span style="color:Black"> Who buys vote-buying? How, How much, and at What Cost?, <b>*Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization*</b> 193 (2022): 98-124. </span>

	<font size="2.5"> In this paper, I estimate the causal effect of a local food-subsidy program on electoral outcomes. I exploit the variation in voters’ walking distances from the program stores to identify their accessibility to the program. I find that a distributive spending of ~5% of GDP per capita buys an additional vote for the incumbent. I then investigate who –based on partisanship– responds to the subsidy, and how much and how they respond. The findings indicate that all types of voters respond to the distributive spending in line with the reciprocity rule; however, they respond through different channels and in different magnitude. Importantly, the salient channel for opposition voters is abstention-buying, whereas incumbent supporters respond by an increased turnout. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Reelection Incentives, Abuse of Law, and Its Economic Cost: Evidence from Public Procurement
	*(with [Serkant Adiguzel](https://serkantadiguzel.com/) and [Murat Koyuncu](https://academics.boun.edu.tr/mkoyuncu/))* </span>
	
	<font size="2.5"> TThere has typically been a costly gap between written laws and their practice due to rent extraction incentives of public officials. In this paper, we investigate whether reelection incentives limit  law abuse by public officials. To do so, we compare the behavior of elected mayors with that of appointed mayors using Differences-in-Differences (DiD) design in a setting where some elected mayors were replaced with appointed trustee mayors by the central government. Our findings indicate that appointed mayors are 23\% more likely than their elected counterparts to abuse an unforeseen events clause of the procurement law to expand their discretion in contract awarding. This misconduct comes at the expense of a decrease in the use of sealed-bid auctions, which are more likely to result in competitive contracts. We show that such abuse of law lowers rebate values by 9% and increases contract prices by 23%. Our calculations further indicate that trustee mayors would have saved $95 million (i.e., 13% of their total procurement expenditure in 2018) had they not engaged in such misconduct. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Vaccination as Social Contract Enforcement in Politically Polarized Settings: Evidence from Randomized Survey Experiment in Turkey
	*(with [Murat Koyuncu](https://academics.boun.edu.tr/mkoyuncu/), [Sebastian Schneider](https://sebastianoschneider.com/) and [Matthias Sutter](https://www.coll.mpg.de/matthias-sutter))* </span>
	
	<font size="2.5"> Social norms facilitate coordination among large groups of people in a plethora of economic and social domains. Their effectiveness however depends on the successful enforcement of these norms, which becomes increasingly difficult in polarized settings. In this paper, using a large-scale survey experiment on a representative sample of Turkey, we investigate vaccination as a social contract enforcement. In doing so, we first document the characteristics of people who conform to --pro-vaxxers-- and who violate --anti-vaxxers-- this social contract, and show that political affiliation predicts attitudes towards vaccination even in times of crisis such as COVID-19 pandemic. Using standard economic games, we then demostrate that each group exhibits outgroup bias against the other, and that this outgroup bias is also affected by political polarization. More specifically, pro-vaxxers who believe that  anti-vaxxers vote for a different party from their preferred one --or vice versa-- exhibit heightened outgroup bias. Finally, using randomized informational treatments, we show that a partially effective way of mitigating outgroup bias in such polarized contexts might be to trigger a social identity that is shared across groups. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> The Olympic Effect: Fact or Fiction?
	*(with [Nicole Stoelinga](https://www.nicolestoelinga.com/home))* </span> <b>(Under Review)</b>
	
	<font size="2.5"> Hosting the Olympic Games implies tremendous costs and uncertain profits, yet countries historically have been striving to host this mega event and bidding decisively. More recently though, countries are withdrawing their bids from the election procedure. This puzzling historical interest in hosting the games and the recent trend of withdrawals cast doubt on the existence of the so-called Olympic effect: the positive impact of the Olympics on international trade. In this paper, we estimate the Olympic effect on long-term exports using the synthetic control method. We show that the Olympic effect is more pronounced for countries that stand to gain from an international publicity. The results also present the novel insight that a substantial positive Olympic effect is only associated with earlier games. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Class Voting and Economic Policy Preferences: A Predictive Modelling Approach </span>
	
	<font size="2.5"> It is widely assumed that class divisions in economic preferences have become increasingly blurred over time due to higher living standards. Nevertheless, the previous literature lacks a systematic method to quantify the extent of this blurring of class divisions --if it exists at all-- and to track its evolution over time and across space. To this end, using predictive modeling, I first develop a new measure of class distinctiveness in economic preferences. I then estimate this new measure in 18 European countries for three points in time. After validating the newly developed measure, I test whether the class distinctiveness in economic preferences can explain the variation in the strength of class-based voting. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Leadership, Social Networks and Workplace Climate Through a Gender Lens
	*(with [Sule Alan](https://sulealan.com/), [Gozde Corekcioglu](https://www.gozdecorekcioglu.com), [Matthias Sutter](https://www.coll.mpg.de/matthias-sutter))* </span>
	
	 <font size="2.5">  Using uniquely detailed data from over 2000 professionals in 24 large corporations in Turkey, we investigate how female leaders shape workplace in the corporate world. First, we document that female leaders do not possess ``male-like'' characteristics but rather preserve their female qualities and they shape social interactions and workplace climate differently from male leaders. We show that the gender of leaders has a significant impact on the structure of social networks within firms. Homophilic professional ties among male workers characterize departments with male leadership. We show that female leadership breaks male homophily and creates a less segregated work place. In female-led departments, both males and females establish more professional links with their female colleagues. Workplace climate is healthier when workers establish professional and personal support links with their leaders, and female leaders are significantly more likely than male leaders to develop such links with their female subordinates. However, female employees paint a darker picture of the workplace climate when working under non-supportive female leaders. Finally, using a subsample of the firms, we show that females working under female leaders are less likely to quit their job, and have higher promotion prospects. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Reputation Signalling and Exports in Contract-Intensive Industries
	*(with [Nicole Stoelinga](https://www.nicolestoelinga.com/home))* </span> 
	
	<font size="2.5"> Reputation plays a crucial role in business and trade. In this paper, we argue that contract-intensive industries are more likely to suffer from a reputation trap due to their heavy reliance on relationship-specific inputs that are otherwise not sold on exchange. We then argue that a way out of this trap is to have a third-party organization signalling reputation on behalf of them. We test the effectiveness of this strategy using the Olympics Games as an instrument to signal reputation and to increase the export levels of contract-intensive industries. We find that hosting the Olympics lead to ~20% increase in the exports of these industries compared to non-contract-intensive industries.  </font>
