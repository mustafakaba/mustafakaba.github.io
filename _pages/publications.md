	<p id="abstract1" style="display: none;"><font size="1.5"> In this paper, I estimate the causal effect of a local food-subsidy program on electoral outcomes. I exploit the variation in voters’ walking distances from the program stores to identify their accessibility to the program. I find that a distributive spending of ~5% of GDP per capita buys an additional vote for the incumbent. I then investigate who –based on partisanship– responds to the subsidy, and how much and how they respond. The findings indicate that all types of voters respond to the distributive spending in line with the reciprocity rule; however, they respond through different channels and in different magnitude. Importantly, the salient channel for opposition voters is abstention-buying, whereas incumbent supporters respond by an increased turnout. </font> </p> [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268121004704?casa_token=mINj6z4gSncAAAAA:HseceyY_9La3dcnzuooAIVwuXkocSNSEf82nIApVwtgZHwZfcuqqGe93t2cTRWdZLlSthtjK){: .btn--research}{:target="_blank"}

* <span style="color:Black"> Social Norms, Political Polarization, and Vaccination Attitudes: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Turkey
	*(with [Murat Koyuncu](https://academics.boun.edu.tr/mkoyuncu/), [Sebastian Schneider](https://sebastianoschneider.com/) and [Matthias Sutter](https://www.coll.mpg.de/matthias-sutter))* </span> <b>(Submitted)</b>
	
	<font size="2.5"> This paper examines the role of social norms and political polarization in shaping vaccination attitudes and behaviors in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Using a large-scale representative survey experiment in Turkey, we first show that political affiliation is a strong predictor of attitudes towards vaccination. We then use standard economic games to measure the extent of polarization caused by subjects' attitudes towards vaccination. We find that pro- and anti-vaxxers discriminate each other substantially. Furthermore, when pro- and anti-vaxxers perceive a political difference between them, this polarization is exacerbated. Finally, using randomized informational treatments, we show that the promotion of a broadly shared social identity might mitigate this outgroup discrimination. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> The Olympic Effect: Fact or Fiction?
	*(with [Nicole Stoelinga](https://www.nicolestoelinga.com/home))* </span> <b>(Submitted)</b>
	
	<font size="2.5"> Hosting the Olympic Games implies tremendous costs and uncertain profits, yet countries historically have been striving to host this mega event and bidding decisively. More recently though, countries are withdrawing their bids from the election procedure. This puzzling historical interest in hosting the games and the recent trend of withdrawals cast doubt on the existence of the so-called Olympic effect: the positive impact of the Olympics on international trade. In this paper, we estimate the Olympic effect on long-term exports using the synthetic control method. We show that the Olympic effect is more pronounced for countries that stand to gain from an international publicity. The results also indicate that a substantial positive Olympic effect is only associated with earlier games. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Unforeseen Events or Unscrupulous Officials? Electoral Accountability and Law Abuse in Public Procurement
	*(with [Serkant Adiguzel](https://serkantadiguzel.com/) and [Murat Koyuncu](https://academics.boun.edu.tr/mkoyuncu/))* </span>
	
	<font size="2.5"> This paper examines whether electoral accountability deters public officials from abusing the law, using a novel indicator of law abuse that measures the unjustified use of the *unforeseen events clause*: an exception clause common in procurement regulations that grants officials with more discretion at times of *force majeure* events. By exploiting a natural experiment and applying a staggered Differences-in-Differences (DiD) design, we find that public officials who lack reelection incentives are 23 pp more likely to abuse the unforeseen events clause than those who face reelection incentives. This abuse of law inflates contract prices by 23% and reduces value for money by 40%. These results are robust to various specification checks, including a Regression Discontinuity in Time (RDiT) design. We rule out the possibility that the documented effects are driven by better quality procurement due to the increased discretion. However, we find no evidence that electoral accountability deters more subtle malpractices, such as cost manipulation. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Leadership, Social Networks and Workplace Climate Through a Gender Lens
	*(with [Sule Alan](https://sulealan.com/), [Gozde Corekcioglu](https://www.gozdecorekcioglu.com), [Matthias Sutter](https://www.coll.mpg.de/matthias-sutter))* </span>
	
	 <font size="2.5">  Using uniquely detailed data from over 2000 professionals in 24 large corporations in Turkey, we investigate how female leaders shape workplace in the corporate world. First, we document that female leaders do not possess ``male-like'' characteristics but rather preserve their female qualities and they shape social interactions and workplace climate differently from male leaders. We show that the gender of leaders has a significant impact on the structure of social networks within firms. Homophilic professional ties among male workers characterize departments with male leadership. We show that female leadership breaks male homophily and creates a less segregated work place. In female-led departments, both males and females establish more professional links with their female colleagues. Workplace climate is healthier when workers establish professional and personal support links with their leaders, and female leaders are significantly more likely than male leaders to develop such links with their female subordinates. However, female employees paint a darker picture of the workplace climate when working under non-supportive female leaders. Finally, using a subsample of the firms, we show that females working under female leaders are less likely to quit their job, and have higher promotion prospects. </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Reputation Signalling and Exports in Contract-Intensive Industries
	*(with [Nicole Stoelinga](https://www.nicolestoelinga.com/home))* </span> 
	
	<font size="2.5"> Reputation plays a crucial role in business and trade. In this paper, we argue that contract-intensive industries are more likely to suffer from a reputation trap due to their heavy reliance on relationship-specific inputs that are otherwise not sold on exchange. We then argue that a way out of this trap is to have a third-party organization signalling reputation on behalf of them. We test the effectiveness of this strategy using the Olympics Games as an instrument to signal reputation and to increase the export levels of contract-intensive industries. We find that hosting the Olympics lead to ~20% increase in the exports of these industries compared to non-contract-intensive industries.  </font>

* <span style="color:Black"> Class Voting and Economic Policy Preferences: A Predictive Modelling Approach </span>
	
	<font size="2.5"> Economic policy preferences are often thought to be less class-based over time due to improved living standards. Yet, there is no clear way to measure the degree of class distinctiveness in economic preferences and how it varies over time and space. In this paper, I introduce a novel measure of class distinctiveness in economic policy preferences based on predictive modeling and estimate it for 18 European countries at three different points in time. I then validate this new measure and explore its implications for class-based voting. </font>
