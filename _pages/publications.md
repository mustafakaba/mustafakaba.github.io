## Working Papers

1. Leadership, Social Networks and Workplace Climate Through a Gender Lens
	*(with [Sule Alan](https://sulealan.com/), [Gozde Corekcioglu](https://www.gozdecorekcioglu.com), [Matthias Sutter](https://www.coll.mpg.de/matthias-sutter))*
	
	Using uniquely detailed data from over 1700 professionals in 23 large corporations, we show that the gender of leaders has a significant impact on the structure of social networks within firms. Homophilic professional ties among male workers characterize departments with male leadership. Female leadership breaks male homophily and create a less segregated workplace. In female-led departments, both males and females establish more professional links with their female colleagues and leaders.  Workplace climate is healthier when workers establish professional support links with their leaders, and female leaders are significantly more likely than male leaders to develop such links with their subordinates. We also show that turnover is significantly lower in female-led departments. Our results suggest that increasing female presence in corporate decision-making positions may be a profitable way to improve organizational culture.
	
2. Estimating the Olympic effect: a synthetic control approach
	*(with [Nicole Stoelinga](https://www.nicolestoelinga.com/home))*
	
	Hosting the Olympic games involves tremendous initial costs, yet countries still bid for it in the hopes of being awarded the games. A prominent explanation put forward in the previous literature for this seemingly puzzling interest is that hosting the Olympic games boosts exports and growth. In this paper, we outline potential pitfalls and problems with the various econometric methods used in this literature. We then address these issues by using the synthetic control method (SCM). Estimating the Olympic effect in a case-by-case manner using the SCM, we document that the Olympic effect is not a universal phenomenon but rather an idiosyncratic effect. 
	
3. Class Distinctiveness and Voting
	
	It is widely assumed that class divisions in economic preferences have become increasingly blurred over time due to higher living standards. Nevertheless, the previous literature lacks a systematic method to quantify the extent of this blurring of class divisions –if it exists at all– and to track its evolution over time and across space. To this end, using predictive modeling, I first develop a new measure of class distinctiveness in economic preferences. I then estimate this new measure in 18 European countries for three points in time. After validating the newly developed measure, I test whether the class distinctiveness in economic preferences can explain the variation in the strength of class-based voting.
