In my dissertation, I aim to answer the following questions: 'how can we explain the variation we see in political media capture strategies?', 'what are the effects of media capture strategies on pro-government coverage?', and 'how does ownership characteristics and structure determine media bias?'. I use formal modelling and big data to answer these questions.
