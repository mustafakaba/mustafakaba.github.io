I am currently a Senior Research Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods](https://www.coll.mpg.de/) in Bonn and a member of the [Center for Social and Economic Behavior](https://c-seb.de/en/) in Cologne. I have recevied my Ph.D. in economics from the European University Institute in 2020. I also hold an MA in economics (2016) and a BA in industrial engineering (2014) from Boğaziçi University, İstanbul.

My research focuses on political economy and behavioral economics with a focus on the intersection of the two. I have a keen interest in voting behavior, policy preferences of individuals, and their determinants. Part of my research seeks to understand how social identity and individual-level traits, such as ingroup bias, conformity, or reciprocity, affect voting behavior and preferred policies in different domains, such as redistribution or cultural politics. 

My other projects ranges from the effects of electoral competition on public procurement to the reputational effects of the Olympic games and the perceived workplace climate in large corporations with a focus on social networks and gender. I use a variety of methods in these research projects including applied microeconometrics, field and survey experiments, network analysis, predictive modeling, cluster analysis, etc.
