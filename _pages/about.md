Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science at Duke University, and I am also affiliated with [DevLab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com), where I am part of the [Machine Learning for Peace project](https://www.devlabduke.com/machinelearningforpeace). I specialize in Political Economy and Political Methodology. I hold an M.A. in Economics, a B.A. in Economics, and a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations, all from Boğaziçi University, Istanbul.

I am broadly interested in democratic backsliding and political economy of media. In my dissertation, I develop a political media capture theory to explain the variation we see in media capture strategies. I also look at how such strategies affect media bias and how ownership characteristics and structure shape whether such bias is demand-driven (because of consumers) or supply-driven (because of media owners).

I also have some works aiming to explain the determinants of popular support for aspiring autocrats. My work has been published in the *Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy*.
