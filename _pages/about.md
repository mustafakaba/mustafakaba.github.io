Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science at Duke University and I am also affiliated with [DevLab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com), where I am part of the Machine Learning for Peace project. I specialize in Political Economy and Political Methodology. I hold an M.A. in Economics, a B.A. in Economics, and a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations, all from Boğaziçi University, Istanbul.

My dissertation is on political media captures and media bias. In particular, I work on the effect of favor exchanges on media bias, as well as understanding how ownership characteristics and structure determine media bias using big data approach and deep learning. I am also working on a formal model of political media capture.

I also have some works aiming to understand how popular support persists for regimes witnessing democratic backliding. My work has been published in the *Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy*.
