Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science at Duke University and a Middle East Initiative predoctoral [fellow](https://www.belfercenter.org/person/serkant-adiguzel) at the Harvard Kennedy School. I am also affiliated with [DevLab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com), where I am part of the [Machine Learning for Peace project](https://www.devlabduke.com/machinelearningforpeace). I specialize in Political Economy and Political Methodology. I hold an M.A. in Economics, a B.A. in Economics, and a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations, all from Boğaziçi University, Istanbul.

I am broadly interested in democratic backsliding, the political economy of media, and regime transitions. I study the multiple channels, such as manipulating the informational environment and providing public services, through which would-be autocrats solidify their popular support. In my dissertation, I develop a political media capture theory to explain the variation we see in media capture strategies. I also look at how such strategies affect media bias and how ownership characteristics and structure shape whether such bias is demand-driven (because of consumers) or supply-driven (because of media owners). 

I also have some works aiming to explain how the provision of public goods/services impacts popular support for aspiring autocrats. My work has been published in the *Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy*.
