I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute](https://www.coll.mpg.de/) in Bonn (on leave as a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley during Fall 2023). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the European University Institute under the supervision of David K. Levine and Arthur Schram. </span>

<span style="color:Black; font-size: 14px"> I am an applied microeconomist working on political economy and behavioral economics. I study how beliefs, incentives, and institutional structures shape economic behavior and policy outcomes using applied microeconometrics, field experiments, and large-scale representative survey experiments. One of my recent projects examines the interplay between electoral accountability and discretion, particularly how these elements sway the abuse of power and economic performance in public procurement of goods and services. For a comprehensive look at my research, please visit my [research page](https://mustafakaba.github.io/research/). </span> 

<span style="color:Black; font-size: 14px"> I also work as a consultant for the World Bank and occasionally teach econometrics courses at the Cologne Graduate School in Management, Economics and Social Sciences. </span>

<span style="color:Black; font-size: 14px"> **I will be available for interviews on the economics job market this academic year!**  </span>
