I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute](https://www.coll.mpg.de/) in Bonn and an affiliate of the [C-SEB](https://c-seb.de/en/). I have received my Ph.D. in Economics from the European University Institute (2021) under the supervision of David K. Levine and Arthur Schram. 

I am an applied microeconomist working on political economy and behavioral economics. My research focuses on understanding economic behavior, preferences, and perceptions in various economic and social settings using applied microeconometrics, field experiments, and large-scale survey experiments. You can visit my [research page](https://mustafakaba.github.io/research/) for an overview of my projects.
