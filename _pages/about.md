I am currently a Senior Research Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods](https://www.coll.mpg.de/) in Bonn and a member of the [Center for Social and Economic Behavior](https://c-seb.de/en/) in Cologne.

I have recevied my PhD in Economics (2020) from the European University Institute under the supervisions of Prof. David K. Levine and Prof. Arthur Schram. I hold an MA in Economics (2016) and a BA in Industrial Engineering (2014) both from Boğaziçi University, İstanbul.

My research interests include applied microeconometrics, behavioral economics, and political economy. I use a variety of methods in my research including causal inference methods, field experiments, network analysis, predictive modeling, and cluster analysis along with other statistical tools.
