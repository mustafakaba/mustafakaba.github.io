I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute](https://www.coll.mpg.de/) in Bonn (on leave at UC Berkeley during Fall 2023). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the European University Institute under the supervision of David K. Levine and Arthur Schram. </span>

<span style="color:Black; font-size: 14px"> I am an applied microeconomist working on political economy and behavioral economics. I study how beliefs, incentives, and institutional structures shape economic behavior and policy outcomes using applied microeconometrics, field experiments, and large-scale representative survey experiments. For a comprehensive look at my research, please visit my [research page](https://mustafakaba.github.io/research/). </span>
